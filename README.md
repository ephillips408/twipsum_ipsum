I have removed the Twitter API access keys. If you would like to use this code, it will be necessary to create a Twitter developer account, create your own app, and use the keys provided there.

For this example:
Access Token == access_token in the TweetMiner class
Access Token Secret == access_secret in the TweetMiner class
API Key = consumer_key in the TweetMiner class
API Secret Key = consumer_secret in the TweetMiner class

I would also like to give credit to Richard Chadwick, who created the TweetMiner class that I used.
The link for the article where I used code is as follows:

I commented out the code that I didn't need, but I chose to leave it in case if someone copying this code would like to use the class in its entirety
